Gabriela - Changes caused by Task 8 - Pokemon, Items

The pokemon constructor had to be changed, because of new types (so that new types would be allowed).
Before the change we had a switch with 4 cases, afterwards it needed to be changed into a switch with 8 cases.

During the code review together, we have decided that switch could be changed to something shorter, 
we explored the possible options and realized that the valueOf() function of enums can be applied. 
We found the valueOf() function in Java docs, when researching enums.

My class (Items) did not have to change, because it had a single responsibility of creating items and returning
values of the objects, which meant it was independent from the PokemonType class.
