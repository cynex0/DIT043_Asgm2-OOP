Victoria - Changes prompted by task 8 - Multiplier

Before the change the multiplier calculation was a part of the attack() function and it worked well in terms of readability and simplicity, 
because there were only 6 different combinations. 
But as a result of the change there were now a lot more cases to handle, which made the readability low if it would be kept in the attack() 
function and it would not be an optimal and clean solution.
To solve this i moved the responsibility to the PokemonType enum instead, since the multiplier is based on types it made sense to make it the 
responsibility of PokemonType class to determine the multiplier value, as it is based only on the types and could be potentially used in something
else besides attack(). 

After moving it, the multiplier had to be modified to handle all the new cases, and the initial intemplementation was to 
experiment with if-else statements, but i realized this solution could be made more effective and more clean, 
and we started researching to determine what would be the best. 
And since the PokemonType class was Maksims responsibility, he started working on this as well.
